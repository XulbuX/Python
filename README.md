## Projects

### Commands
Inside `Commands` are a lot of Python files, which can be added to the system paths to be run as commands. You can figure out what each command does in the [`README.md`](./Projects/Commands/README.md) of the corresponding repo.

### x-convert
Inside `x-convert` is a file, supposed to be run as a command, used for converting one type of code into another type of code. For more information, take a look at the [`README.md`](./Projects/x-convert/README.md) of the corresponding repo.


## Experiments

### SendToFriend
These are **harmless** prank scripts (*also as [executables](./Experiments/SendToFriend/executables)*), that do all sorts of annoying things.
Every script or executable has an exact description of what it does in the [`README.md`](./Experiments/SendToFriend/README.md) of the corresponding repo.
> [!CAUTION]
> These scripts lead to actions on your PC that you might not want.<br>
> However, it is important to note that
> **none of these scripts will cause damage to your PC**.
